# Section:1- Getting Started
- Introduction 
- Programming Paradigms
  In computer science we have various programming paradigms or styles of programming like procedural, 
  functional, object-oriented, event-driven, logic, aspect-oriented, and so on. Out of all these, 
  object-oriented and functional are the two most popular paradigms we use these days.
  So these programming paradigms are ways or styles of writing code. They're not programming languages. 
  We classify programming languages based on the paradigms they support. Some languages like Smalltalk 
  support a single paradigm. Other languages like Python, Ruby, Java, and JavaScript, to name a few, 
  support multiple paradigms.
